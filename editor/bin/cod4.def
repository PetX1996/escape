/*QUAKED light (0 1 0) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) PRIMARY_OMNI PRIMARY_SPOT PRIMARY_SCRIPTABLE PRIMARY_NOSHADOWMAP
"def" sets which light definition asset to use; these are made in asset manager.  This controls the shape of the light falloff curve.
"radius" controls the cutoff distance of the light.  The light falloff texture maps its left side to the light origin and the right side to the radius.  The rightmost pixel in the falloff texture is assumed to be black.
"_color" sets the color of the light.  The biggest value gets scaled to 1; this means that 0.1 0.1 0.1 is the same as 1 1 1.
"intensity" controls how bright a light is when the falloff texture is pure white.  A value of 1 is fullbright; smaller values are dimmer.
"PRIMARY_OMNI" and "PRIMARY_SPOT", if checked, give the light higher quality lighting and dynamic shadows.  Only one primary light may affect each world surface.  They both require spotlight settings to control where dynamic shadows lie, but unlike normal spotlights, "PRIMARY_OMNI" lights do not get attenuated by angle from the spot direction.
"PRIMARY_SCRIPTABLE" makes a primary light show up as an entity to script.
"PRIMARY_NOSHADOWMAP" prevents a primary light from ever having a shadowmap.  This is implied by fov_outer > 120.

A light pointed at a target will be a spotlight facing the target.  They default to having a circle with 64 unit radius around the target.
"fov_outer" overrides the fov of a spotlight from the 64 unit circle around the target.  It is in degrees.  A value of 90 would go +/-45 degrees from center, for 90 degrees total.  The default is to use the target to set the fov.
"fov_inner" sets the fov of the inner cone.  Spotlights only fade with angle between fov_inner and fov_outer.  Fov_inner is the same units as fov_outer; it should always be less than fov_outer.  The default is 0.
"exponent" changes the falloff of the spotlight between "fov_inner" and "fov_outer".  The default value of 0 means there is no falloff.  A value of 1 gives linear falloff.  Higher integers give steeper falloffs.

"maxturn" sets how many degrees script is allowed to turn a PRIMARY_SCRIPTABLE light from its initial direction.
"maxmove" sets how many units script is allowed to move a PRIMARY_SCRIPTABLE light from its initial position.

every map should have exactly one worldspawn.
music -  Music wav file. Can optionally specify intro & loop files to play
ambienttrack -  Ambient wav file.
gravity - 800 is default gravity
message - Text to print during connection process
ambient - Ambient light value (single scale, 1 = full bright, 2 = full overbright, must use '_color')
_color - Ambient light color (RGB triple, must be used with 'ambient')
sunColor - RGB values for direct sunlight color (color only, not brightness, 0-1 scale, works with 'sunlight')
sunLight - Intensity of the sun (1 = fullbright, 2 = full overbright for something facing directly at the sun, must use 'suncolor')
sunRadiosity - Intensity of the sun used for radiosity.  If not set, 'sunLight' is used for radiosity too.  Set higher than 'sunLight' to make sun radiosity stronger.
sunDiffuseColor - RGB values for diffuse sunlight color (color only, not brightness, 0-1 scale, works with 'diffusefraction')
diffuseFraction - fraction of sunlight intensity to come from the diffuse lighting (in range 0-1; eg, 0.5, works with 'sundiffusecolor')
sunDirection - pitch-yaw-roll for direction to sun (eg, sundirection -45 135 0).  Pitch is usually 0 to -90 and yaw is any angle.
sunIsPrimaryLight - set to 0 to make the sun a secondary light.  If absent or non-zero, the sun is a primary light.
radiosityScale - how much light bounces on each radiosity pass.  1 is the "physically correct" default.  Smaller values reduce radiosity, larger values exaggerate it.
contrastGain - 0 to 1 scale for adding contrast to bumpmap lighting.  0 is no added contrast, 1 is maximum.  Higher values may have artifacts.
northyaw  yaw angle that denotes the direction of north
reflection_color_correction - name of the default color correction to use for reflection probe
reflection_ignore_portals - if not 0 or blank ignore portals when finding closest reflection probe for static geometry.
coll_node_limit - if set to a non-zero value limit the number of children per node in the collision trees.
blocksize - if set to a non-zero use for the blocksize when compiling the map.  Blocksize will cut the map geometry, increasing the total geometry and memory but it may help performance in some cases.
